# Mixed Messages Project

## Project description

Mixed-up philosophy quote generator program, part of the [Full-Stack Engineer Career Path at CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

Every time a user runs a program, they get a new, randomized, mixed-up philosophy quote. The message that the program outputs is made up of four different pieces of data: author, philosophy, quote and year between author birth and passing.

The authors, philosophies and quotes are from Karan Dahiya's `philosophy-quotes-API` (see Acknowledgements) and the birth and passing dates were retrieved from Wikipedia.
