# Mixed Messages Project

## Project description

Mixed-up philosophy quote generator program, part of the [Full-Stack Engineer Career Path at CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

Every time a user runs a program, they get a new, randomized, mixed-up philosophy quote. The message that the program outputs is made up of four different pieces of data: author, philosophy, quote and a year between the author's years of birth and passing.

The authors, philosophies and quotes are from Karan Dahiya's `philosophy-quotes-API` (see Acknowledgements.) The birth and passing years were retrieved from Wikipedia.

## Requirements

- Node.JS (tested on v16.13.2)
- A web browser (tested on Edge 99.0.1131.3 (Official build) dev (64-bit))

## Running the program

After cloning the repo locally, run:

```sh
node mixed-messages.js
```

```text
$ node mixed-messages.js
